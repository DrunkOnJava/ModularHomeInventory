## Current Test Execution Status

### ‚úÖ Working Tests
- **Snapshot Tests**: Most snapshot tests pass (439 tests)
- **Unit Tests**: Module unit tests functioning

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
1. **Performance Tests**: Skip execution when not in CI environment (by design)
2. **Integration Tests**: Need to be added to test scheme
3. **Some Snapshot Tests**: Minor failures due to UI changes since reference snapshots

### üîß Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
fastlane test_all

# Run specific test suites
fastlane test_unit
fastlane test_integration
fastlane test_performance
fastlane test_security
fastlane test_snapshots
fastlane test_ui_matrix

# Run with CI environment
export CI=true && fastlane test_performance

# Generate coverage report
fastlane coverage_report
```
