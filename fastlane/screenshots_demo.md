# Fastlane Snapshot Setup Complete

I've successfully set up Fastlane's snapshot feature for your HomeInventory app. Here's what was configured:

## Configuration Files Created

1. **Fastfile** - Contains lanes for:
   - `screenshots` - Generate screenshots
   - `frame` - Add device frames to screenshots
   - `screenshots_all` - Generate and frame in one command

2. **Snapfile** - Configured for:
   - Device: iPhone 16 Pro Max
   - Language: English (en-US)
   - Status bar override enabled
   - Clear previous screenshots enabled

3. **UI Test Target** - Created `HomeInventoryModularUITests` with:
   - Basic screenshot flow through app tabs
   - Accessibility screenshot tests
   - SnapshotHelper.swift for Fastlane integration

## How to Use

1. First, ensure the app builds successfully:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

2. To generate screenshots:
   ```bash
   bundle exec fastlane screenshots
   ```

3. Screenshots will be saved in `./fastlane/screenshots/`

## Customization Options

### Add More Devices
Edit `Snapfile` and add devices:
```ruby
devices([
  "iPhone 16 Pro Max",
  "iPhone 16 Pro",
  "iPad Pro 11-inch (M4)"
])
```

### Add More Languages
Edit `Snapfile` and add languages:
```ruby
languages([
  "en-US",
  "es-ES",
  "fr-FR"
])
```

### Modify Screenshot Flow
Edit `HomeInventoryModularUITests.swift` to:
- Add more screenshots
- Navigate to specific screens
- Show different states

## Advanced Features

### Frame Screenshots
Add device frames to make screenshots App Store ready:
```bash
bundle exec fastlane frame
```

### Upload to App Store
Once you have your App Store Connect credentials:
```bash
bundle exec fastlane upload_screenshots
```

## Tips for Better Screenshots

1. **Prepare Demo Data**: Add sample items, receipts, and collections before running screenshots
2. **Test Locally First**: Run UI tests in Xcode to verify the flow works
3. **Use Launch Arguments**: Pass special flags to show specific states
4. **Override Status Bar**: Already configured for clean screenshots

## Troubleshooting

If screenshots fail:
1. Make sure simulators are downloaded: Xcode > Settings > Platforms
2. Reset simulator if needed: Device > Erase All Content and Settings
3. Check that UI test scheme exists in Xcode
4. Ensure app permissions are granted (camera, notifications)

The setup is ready for when you want to generate App Store screenshots!
