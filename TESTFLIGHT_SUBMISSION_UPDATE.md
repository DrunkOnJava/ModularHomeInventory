# TestFlight Submission Update

## Current Status
- **Date**: June 26, 2025  
- **Version**: 1.0.6 (Build 8)
- **Issue**: Export compliance code mismatch

## Problem
The app's Info.plist contains an export compliance code (ecf076d3-130b-4b7d-92e0-6a69e07b5b6d) that doesn't match what's configured in App Store Connect.

## Resolution Required
You need to:

### Option 1: Update Export Compliance in App Store Connect
1. Log in to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Go to MyHome Inventory Pro app
3. Navigate to the "Features" tab
4. Select "Encryption"
5. Either:
   - Copy the existing export compliance code and I'll rebuild with it
   - Or select "App does not use encryption" if your app doesn't use encryption

### Option 2: Manual Upload via Xcode
1. Open Xcode
2. Window → Organizer
3. Find the archive from today (June 26, 2025)
4. Click "Distribute App"
5. Choose "App Store Connect" → "Upload"
6. Follow the prompts (Xcode will handle the compliance)

### Option 3: Use Transporter App
1. Download [Transporter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transporter/id1450874784) from Mac App Store
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Drag the IPA file: `~/Desktop/HomeInventoryExport/HomeInventoryModular.ipa`
4. Click "Deliver"

## What I've Done
✅ Fixed the missing NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription privacy key
✅ Successfully built and exported the IPA
✅ Attempted upload but blocked by export compliance mismatch

## Files Ready
- Archive: `~/Desktop/HomeInventory.xcarchive`
- IPA: `~/Desktop/HomeInventoryExport/HomeInventoryModular.ipa`
- All privacy keys added (Camera, Speech Recognition, Microphone)

## Next Steps
Please use one of the options above to complete the submission. The export compliance issue requires your action in App Store Connect or manual upload through Xcode/Transporter.
