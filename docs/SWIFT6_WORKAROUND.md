# Swift 6 Compatibility Workaround for TestFlight Submission

## Issue Summary

The project encounters a package resolution error when building with Xcode using Swift 6.1.2:
```
the manifest is backward-incompatible with Swift < 6.0 because the tools-version 
was specified in a subsequent line of the manifest, not the first line
```

This occurs even though all Package.swift files correctly have `// swift-tools-version: 5.9` on the first line.

## Root Cause

- System Swift version: 6.1.2
- Project requires: Swift 5.9
- Xcode's Swift 6 toolchain has stricter parsing rules for Package.swift files

## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Manual Archive and Upload (Recommended)

1. **Open Xcode GUI**
   ```bash
   open HomeInventoryModular.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Configure Project**
   - Select the project in navigator
   - Go to Build Settings
   - Ensure Swift Language Version is set to "Swift 5"
   - Set SWIFT_VERSION = 5.9 if needed

3. **Build and Archive**
   - Select "Any iOS Device (arm64)" as destination
   - Product → Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K)
   - Product → Archive
   - Wait for archive to complete

4. **Upload to TestFlight**
   - In Organizer, select the archive
   - Click "Distribute App"
   - Choose "App Store Connect"
   - Select "Upload"
   - Use automatic signing
   - Include symbols
   - Submit

### Option 2: Use Legacy Build System

```bash
# Build with legacy system
xcodebuild -project HomeInventoryModular.xcodeproj \
  -scheme HomeInventoryModular \
  -UseModernBuildSystem=NO \
  -configuration Release \
  -sdk iphoneos \
  archive
```

### Option 3: Install Swift 5.9 Toolchain

1. Download Swift 5.9 from https://swift.org/download/
2. Install the toolchain
3. In Xcode: Preferences → Components → Toolchains → Swift 5.9
4. Build normally

### Option 4: Temporary Package.swift Modification

If other options fail, temporarily modify Package.swift files:
```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0  // Temporarily change from 5.9
```

Then revert after building.

## Current Status

- ✅ App builds successfully in Debug mode
- ✅ All code is ready for submission
- ✅ Version 1.0.6 (Build 7) configured
- ✅ Release notes prepared
- ✅ Export compliance configured
- ❌ Blocked by Swift 6 package resolution

## TestFlight Checklist

Once built and archived:

1. **Verify Build Settings**
   - Version: 1.0.6
   - Build: 7
   - Bundle ID: com.homeinventory.app
   - Team: 2VXBQV4XC9

2. **Include in Upload**
   - ✅ Upload symbols
   - ✅ Include bitcode (if available)
   - ✅ Export compliance info

3. **Release Notes**
   ```
   🎉 Home Inventory v1.0.6
   
   🆕 NEW FEATURES:
   • Professional Insurance Reports
   • View-Only Sharing Mode

## Alternative: Direct IPA Creation

If Xcode archive fails:

```bash
# Create payload directory
mkdir -p Payload
cp -r build/Build/Products/Release-iphoneos/HomeInventoryModular.app Payload/

# Create IPA
zip -r HomeInventory.ipa Payload/

# Upload with altool or Transporter
```

*Note: This is a temporary workaround. The long-term solution is to either:
- Update the project to Swift 6 compatibility
- Use a development environment with Swift 5.9
- Configure Xcode to use the correct Swift toolchain*
