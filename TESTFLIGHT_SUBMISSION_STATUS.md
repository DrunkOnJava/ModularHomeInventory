# TestFlight Submission Status

## Current Situation
- **Date**: June 26, 2025
- **Version**: 1.0.6 (Build 8)
- **Status**: Build fails locally due to Items module compilation error

## Issue
The Items module has a Swift compilation error that prevents local builds. This appears to be related to Swift 5.9 compatibility with certain code constructs in the module.

## Recommended Solution: GitHub Actions

Since local builds are failing, use the GitHub Actions workflow that's already configured:

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets
Go to your repository settings on GitHub and add these secrets:

1. **CERTIFICATE_BASE64**
   - Export your distribution certificate from Keychain as .p12
   - Convert to base64: `base64 -i certificate.p12`

2. **CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD**
   - Password used when exporting the certificate

3. **PROVISIONING_PROFILE_BASE64**
   - Download from Apple Developer Portal
   - Convert: `base64 -i "profile.mobileprovision"`

4. **KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD**
   - Any secure password for temporary keychain

5. **APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_ID**
   - From App Store Connect API Keys

6. **APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID**
   - From App Store Connect API Keys

7. **APP_STORE_CONNECT_API_KEY_BASE64**
   - Download .p8 file and convert: `base64 -i AuthKey.p8`

### Step 3: Monitor Workflow
- Check Actions tab on GitHub
- Workflow will build with Swift 5.9 and upload to TestFlight

## Alternative: Manual Xcode Upload

If you prefer manual upload:

1. **Open Xcode**
2. **Select Toolchain**: Xcode → Toolchains → Swift 5.9
3. **Clean Build Folder**: Product → Clean Build Folder
4. **Archive**: Product → Archive
5. **Distribute**: 
   - Window → Organizer
   - Select archive → Distribute App
   - App Store Connect → Upload

## Next Steps
1. Use GitHub Actions (recommended)
2. Or fix the Items module compilation error
3. Or use manual Xcode upload

## Support
If you need help with the Items module error, the issue appears to be in the Swift compilation phase. Consider:
- Checking for Swift 5.9 incompatible syntax
- Temporarily commenting out problematic code
- Using `#if compiler(>=5.9)` directives
